This file serves as a placeholder for the favicon.ico file referenced in the index.html.

In a production environment, you would need to create an actual ICO file with the following specifications:

- favicon.ico - typically 16x16, 32x32, or 48x48 pixels
- Multiple sizes can be included in a single ICO file

The favicon is displayed in browser tabs, bookmarks, and other browser UI elements.
